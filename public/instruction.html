					<h2 class="h4">Objective</h2>
					<p>You will see screenshots of some websites. The objective is to evaluate visual attractiveness of each website screenshot on a scale from 1 to 10.</p>
					<h2 class="h4">Evaluation criteria</h2>
					<p>Even though we ask for a subjective opinion, there should be some certainty and consistency in your evaluations; so in this test, we ask you to think why you give this particular score on a scale of 1-10 to a website when assessing it.
          </p>
					<p>Websites should be assessed by their appearance, not by the information they contain.</p>
					<p><b>We do not evaluate how informative or modern a website is, so its evaluation should not be affected by the factors like these:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li class="text-danger">a website is useful to some particular audience of users</li>
						<li class="text-danger">a website contains a picture of an awesome Ferrari or your favorite Pokemon</li>
						<li class="text-danger">a website is adaptive, made using modern frameworks, has a convenient menu</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>What should influence the evaluation:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li class="text-success">a website is pleasant to look at</li>
						<li class="text-success">well-matched colors are chosen for a website</li>
						<li class="text-success">a website contains high-quality images</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We hope for your conscientiousness and impartiality but being over critical is not necessary too.</p>
					<h2 class="h4">Instruction</h2>
					<p>Hitting a number on the keyboard gives a score on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is the minimum score, 10 is the maximum score. The 0 number on the keyboard is the score of 10.</p>
					<p>To confirm the score and move on the next screen, press Enter.</p>
					<p>To return to the previous screenshot, hit the Backspace ← key.</p>
					<p>If you see a broken screenshot, press the X button instead of the assessment buttons — this marks the screenshot as broken. Don’t forget to mark screenshots as broken if there’s something wrong with an image.</p>
